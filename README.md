## Introduction
An audio transcription program utilizing IBM's Watson Speech to Text tool

One of my favorite Sci-Fi Series of all time in Star Trek and one of the iconic features of a Star Trek show is personal logs. In a Star Trek series, characters maintain audio logs of things that they are doing and can search through their personal logs for keywords or date. While recording an audio file can be done on most computers, getting a transcription with dates can be a bit more complicated. The purpose of this project is to create a python script that can take personal logs and transcribe it into text.

As of now this project takes a wemb file (which is the file format my personal logs are in) and converts it into a written transcription with confidence scores sent from Watson.
